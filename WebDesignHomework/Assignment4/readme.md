## Assignment 4 | Week 4

### _Questions from this week_

1. Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?
   - web pages work by asking servers and connections for information. Whether you are clicking around a site shopping, or even checking out pictures, the website is always pulling and grabbing information from servers about where to go next (next page, another link, checkout, etc)
  
2. What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?
   - a DOM is what connects everything within a webpage, it connects the home page to the shopping cart, product info, 'about us' section, etc

4. What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?
   - !DOCTYPE.html
   - .html
   - (head)
   - (body)
     - *note: I know everything is not bracketed correctly, it was the only way for it to show on the readme

6. What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?
   - The index.html page is another word for the website's homepage. This is what people first see when they go into a website. It should be placed in the area of all of the main page folders
   
8. Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?
   - use clear names for file names, include things that might be similar to each other to make it easier to find
     - example: name the year as 24 at the end of every file name, or make it SB instead of SpringBreak, making it easier to mass produce and find later on
