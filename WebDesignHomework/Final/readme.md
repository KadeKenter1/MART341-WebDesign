## Changes made

I deleted the recipe specific pages off of the website. I tried to duplicate and since there was only 2 different recipes per section, it messed with the column spacing and looked different on each page. I kept the **bulk** one since that ended up being the only one that translated properly.

I also cleaned up a lot of the different code from different weeks. One of the big ones was that I used .navbar class on some pages and .nav on others. I ended up combining these so it all worked together.

Fixed up a lot of the small things that made the website slightly different on each page as well
