## Changes made

I deleted the recipe specific pages off of the website. I tried to duplicate and since there was only 2 different recipes per section, it messed with the column spacing and looked different on each page. I kept the **bulk** one since that ended up being the only one that translated properly.

I also cleaned up a lot of the different code from different weeks. One of the big ones was that I used .navbar class on some pages and .nav on others. I ended up combining these so it all worked together.

Fixed up a lot of the small things that made the website slightly different on each page as well

I feel like this website came together very well - I want to try and add more throughout the future or build more websites to get better at this!

Thank you so much for an amazing semester even with all of my troubles at the start!
