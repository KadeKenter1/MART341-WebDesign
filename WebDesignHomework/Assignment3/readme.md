## Assignment 3 | Week 3

Hello! After trying to do this assignment on 3 separate days I still don't truly understand how to use the software given in this week's assignments
I am unsure if it's the wording you used, but I am nothing but purely confused.

Hopefully, this helps with the coming weeks, but a tutorial would be nice, or using words of actual functions in the program would be helpful instead of using different words that get confusing
- Also, it is very challenging to have to go back to every days assignments to have to remember all the different kinds of typography in this course, it would be nice to have a solid place that I can always find the information for these assignments
