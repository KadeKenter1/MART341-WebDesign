# Files Worked on This Week
## recipe homepage
this week I worked a lot on the recipe homepage a little bit more. I added some more interactive buttons to make the site a little more cozy and inviting
## recipe 3
I added a third recipe - like I said in the week 10 readme, I want to add more recipes every week since it is not super hard to copy and paste one of the sheets and just change around information. I think it will be nice in the long run to have a full recipe page that peers and other people can use!
## index page work
I worked on the index page a little bit too. I used a lot of similar features I have been adding throughout the website to make it all more coherent. I added more hovering effects and made it a bit better looking.

# Notes from this week
This week you required us to have a set of things:
An external CSS style sheet
- I have had this seperate, but am still confused on how to properly use it?
Hover effects
- added hover effects to all of the buttons, most visible on the **recipehomepage.html** page
A self-hosted font
- I used the Courier font for my logo and sub logo
A font from a library
- I used the **Gloria Hallelujah** font from Google Fonts for the recipe pages to make the recipes seem more informal and fun!
Three additional techniques of your choice
- Technique 1: I made my logo larger than before making it pop out more across all pages
- Technique 2: I added **Letter Spacing** to all of the recipe pages to help the ingredients title and instructions title stand out more within the div box
- Technique 3: More text alignment for centering and spacing to make the pages more coherent
## Other Notes
I used a lot of the WSS classes and examples to help build the page and add more involved elements to make the website a bit more advanced.

## For NEXT WEEK
1. Using new recipes - I have done a lot with the same types of recipes. I want my website to truly be full of all kinds of recipes for everyone to use, so I want to start expanding on that asap.
2. Keep playing around with styling on the site - I feel like I add a lot to the website more and more every week but am never fully satisfied with the end result. I want to keep playing around wtih style and color pallets.
3. Try and see about making the individual recipe pages (bulk, vegan, vegetartian, etc) more coherent and like the other ones
