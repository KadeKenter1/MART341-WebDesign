# Notes from this week
## 6 Required Techniques

I am going to use these 6 elements to enhance my page

1. Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
- I added a border to the box in my index page where it asks about what type of recipes do they want. This helps it stand out a bit more to the entire page.
- I also added a border to the buttons as well as the hover effect so that they pop out slightly more

2. Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
- this is very similar to what I have ben doing but I added a second column to my recipe homepage, this helps keep the recipes big enough for all of the sites its used on while also keeps it all well contained

3. Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
- I added padding to the buttons in the recipehomepage and the index page. This helps space out the buttons and maybe on a mobile site could help with not misclicking as frequently

4. Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.
- I added a dropdown to the recipe bar on my index page so its another way to go to the recipe homepage


Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.
Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.
