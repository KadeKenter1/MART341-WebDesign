# Notes from this week
This week I spent a lot of time working on the recipe page specifically - but also added some new stuff as I start to get more recipes in. I added individual pages for people to go in and look at recipes to use depdning on what dietary needs or wants. Some of the things I did differently this week was I changed some of the styling around. I changed the color to a lighter grey for the reicpe homepage to see how I would like it and will change it for the whole website the next weeks assignment. I also wanted to change the layout of the recipe homepage website as well. 

I made a new class for a few different things, one was to center the 2 recipes together so I can fit more stuff onto one page at once. I used this to combine with some of the other elements across the website so I can make it all well organized and compact across the website.

## For NEXT WEEK
1. Use this readme file continuously since all of my other read me files look different
2. Build more onto the other home pages and recipe pages - I want to try and meet again so I can go over the picture mishaps I have been dealing with (i also put it in the discussion post so other peers could maybe help me)
3. I want to try and build some deeper code using some helpful links on the internet to see if I can maybe make a cooler way of enhancing the website. Whether its with animations throughout the website or just some more involving code, I think I could really use something like that to my advantage
4. I want to narrow down color schemes for the website for what I want and what I might want to change or add since the website seems pretty dark in my opinion
