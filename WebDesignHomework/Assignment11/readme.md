# Files Worked on This Week
## recipe homepage
this week I worked a lot on the recipe homepage a little bit more. I added some more interactive buttons to make the site a little more cozy and inviting
## recipe 3
I added a third recipe - like I said in the week 10 readme, I want to add more recipes every week since it is not super hard to copy and paste one of the sheets and just change around information. I think it will be nice in the long run to have a full recipe page that peers and other people can use!

## For NEXT WEEK
1. Using new recipes - I have done a lot with the same types of recipes. I want my website to truly be full of all kinds of recipes for everyone to use, so I want to start expanding on that asap.
