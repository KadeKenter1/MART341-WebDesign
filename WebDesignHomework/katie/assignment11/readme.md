# Week 11
## Katie Illi

# Required Items
- Create a page with an external CSS style sheet
    - has been added for weeks
- Add hover effects to enhance interactivity
    - outside of the current hover effects on the navigation buttons I added _____
- Use an external font that is self-hosted
    - for the self hosted font I used times new roman for all the buttons and body font! I think it is classic, but also adds a more fomal appeal to the websites homepage and other parts!
- Use an external font from a font library
    - for the external font I used the Caprasimo font from Google. I think it has a playful yet modern look to it. I like it alongside the times new roman

# Other elements
- Experiment with different font styles
- Adjust font-weight for emphasis
    - Made headers of each page **bold** to help it stick out more on the page
- Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.
- Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability
- Align text or elements for a clean layout
    - I made the font of the alpha phi header larger since its the title of the page
- Try pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes for additional styling effects
