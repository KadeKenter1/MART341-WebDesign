# Required Items
- Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
    - Not sure if it counts becvause I did it last week - but I made the title header 500% larger to make it stick out more
- Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.
- Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
- Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
- Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
    - I made the information in the history tab into columns instead of rows stacked on top of each other. Changing the padding around so they comfortable fit the page
- Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.
- Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.
- Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
