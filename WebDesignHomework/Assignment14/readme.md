# Files Worked on This Week


# Notes from this week


## Required Stuff
- 3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme.
    - My page is 10+ pages long at this time
- Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.
    -  added bootstrap to my index.html file, recipe-homepage.html file, and my starterknife.html file. After seeing how it looked I am not sure how much I like the addition of the bootstrap since it makes editing the page a little harder since theres a whole other branch to look at now.
- Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.
    - I added the same font elements and used a darker format to make the website look cleaner 
- HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations.  
    - I was struggling to find somewhere in my page for a canvas element to go but I couldn't find anywhere. So I made a page designated for canvas for the sole purpose of this assignment
    - # NOTE #
        - ## here is the linkt of find the canvas page

- JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site.
    - Some of the javascript elements are in the canvas page of the website.

## Other Notes
 - Struggled finding some of the uses for bootstrap and other things wihtin the website. I think for the final submission (if I can) I want to use the plain code without the boot strap. After adding the code it changed a lot of the look of my website and I was not super happy with it as much as I thought I would be.

## For NEXT WEEK
- Get everything all ready for final submission!
