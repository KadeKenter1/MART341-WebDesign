<h1>My Idea</h1>

**The Idea I want to go with is the idea of making a small business based around cooking**

I chose this idea based on my own personal interest. I love cooking and want to use that area of expertise and creativeness and use it to build a cool website! I think this would also be fun to make a store front and make a community type of engagement. I want to be professional yet playful since it is cooking and not a law firm.

Post Reflection

I think I did pretty well with this assignment - going to meet with you on Zoom on Monday to help make sure all of my code is correct and help keep everything working smooth. I helped with the balance by making the background a light grey instead of white so it was not super harsh on the eyes while also making each heading and paragraph text each a light shade of blue. With the headings being a dark blue and the paragraphs being a cornflower blue. I have been struggling to get my link to work so I am unsure of what it all looks like at the end - hopefully going to get it figured out asap - I think this assignment went well. I started getting the hang of it and hopefully when I check out the website (eventually) it looks okay!
