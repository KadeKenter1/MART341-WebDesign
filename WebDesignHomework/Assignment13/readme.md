# Notes from this week
## Required Stuff

At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.
- I have 10+ pages across the site. I have some pages that need more work than others but are still made up in some way. I spent a lot of this week tying together all of the final themes together to make sure every page on the site works right.

Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- The website works great online on all devices. With all the images it can be a little smashed together on mobile but outside of that it works great and the organization stays all put together

Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.
- 

Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.
- There is a clean navigation bar at the top of every page on the site. This helps

Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.
- The recipes section on the navigation bar of the website takes people to the parts of the website that have specific types or recipes or all of them. There are only 5 sections so there is not much else to add and it is very easy to navigate
