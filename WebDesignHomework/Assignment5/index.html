#Idea One
I think a fun idea for a website would be a journal type website. I think it would be fun to use random ideas to write stories about like the WSJ or NYT. I think this idea coukd be very fun and a good creative sided outlet.

#idea Two
I think another fun idea would be to make a small business site. I don't know what kind of business it will be, but it could be fun to think of everything to add. I think adding fun products or a service would be fun!

#Idea Three
I think another fun idea could be a blog. Maybe using it as a way for students to communicate.
    Using it as a way to:
        - communicate
        - Learn about events in the community
        - Keep students connected in the same class
